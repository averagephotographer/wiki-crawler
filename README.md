# Wiki-Crawler
## What's the Wikipedia Game?
### Get Set:
* Obtain two random wiki articles
* Designate one as the start, and the other as the end

### Play:
* Open the starting article
* Look at all the hyperlinks on the page
* Click the link you think will get you closest to the ending article
* Repeat


### Rules:
* NO back button
* Only use hyperlinks that are part of the article itself
  * e.g. don't use the Catagories section at the bottom of the page
